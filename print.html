<p>...and here is how!</p>
<p><code>share secrets safely</code>, or <code>sheesy</code> in short, is a command-line tool which makes
using cryptography powered by <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/"><code>gpg</code></a> easy.</p>
<p>It's there for you and your team to help you avoid putting plain-text secrets into
your repository from day one.</p>
<p>However, there is more to it and this guide will give you an overview of the
difficulties associated with <em>shared secrets</em>, and how to overcome them.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#about-shared-secrets" id="about-shared-secrets"><h2>About shared secrets!</h2></a>
<p><code>secrets</code>, that's knowledge whose possession yields a value. It can be credentials
providing access to databases, which in turn may contain confidential data or all
your customers payment information.
Or it can be a token giving full access to a big companys AWS account with unlimited
credit.</p>
<p>The first line of defense is to never, ever store <code>secrets</code> in plain text! This cannot
be stressed enough. Never do it, ever, and instead read the <a href="vault/first-steps.html">'First Steps'</a>
to learn how to avoid it from day one.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#rotation-rotation-rotation" id="rotation-rotation-rotation"><h2>Rotation, Rotation, Rotation!</h2></a>
<p>An interesting property of <em>shared</em> secrets is that once they have been read, they
must be considered leaked. By using <code>sheesy</code> you try to assure no unauthorized party
gets to easily read them, but authorized parties still read them eventually, adding
the risk of leakage each time.</p>
<p>After adding <code>sheesy</code> into your workflow, it <em>must</em> be your next goal to make it easy
(e.g. automatically) to rotate these secrets. This invalidates any leak and acts like a
reset. The shorter the secrets remain valid, the better when it comes to risk of leakage.</p>
<p><em>If you think further, the safest secrets are the ones that never stay valid for an extended
period of time, and which are tied to a specific entity.</em></p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-tools" id="the-tools"><h2>The Tools</h2></a>
<p>Fortunately all the tooling exists to avoid plain-text secrets and make sharing them
a little safer.
<code>sheesy</code> does nothing more than bringing them together in a single binary.</p>
<p>Those are namely</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>gpg-cryptography</strong>
<ul>
<li>This provides user-identification with public keys as well as proven cryptography</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x547.html"><em>Web of Trust</em></a> helps to conveniently assure public keys actually belong
to the individual, assuring nobody <em>sneaks in</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>sheesy</em> command-line tool</strong>
<ul>
<li>A binary communicating with the <code>gpg</code> cryptography engine via <a href="https://github.com/johnschug/rust-gpgme"><code>gpgme</code></a>.</li>
<li>It provides a great user experience making using <code>gpg</code> easy even without prior
knowledge.</li>
<li>It provides capabilities to make it easy to use <code>sheesy vaults</code> from your
build pipeline.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>pass - the standard unix password manager</strong>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.passwordstore.org">pass</a> is a shell-script which drives the <code>gpg</code> program to make it easier
to use in teams. <code>sheesy</code> vaults are fully compatible to <code>pass</code> vaults.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You might ask yourself why you would chose <code>sheesy</code> over other tools. The comparisons
that follow should be helpful in deciding what's best for you.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#pass" id="pass"><h3>Pass</h3></a>
<p>The <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">standard unix pass</a> is a shell script, which requires the presence of various standard unix tools, <a href="https://git.zx2c4.com/password-store/tree/README">among which</a> are
<code>tree</code> and <code>getopt</code>. The latter are actually not necessarily present, and if they are they may not produce exactly the same
results. On <em>OSX</em> for example, the <code>gpg</code> file suffix is shown instead of hidden, and <code>pass</code> goes in an endless loop if
<code>getopt</code> is broken, which it is by default when <code>brew reinstall gnu-getopt</code> was not invoked.</p>
<p><code>sheesy</code> has only one dependency: <code>gpg</code>, and even there it does not depend on the executable, but rather the <code>gpg-agent</code>.
It does not invoke the <code>gpg</code> command, and thus will not be confused by a change in the way <code>gpg</code> interprets its arguments
between minor version increments.</p>
<p>Besides, as <code>pass</code> just invokes <code>gpg</code>, it suffers from the horrible and hard-to-grok error messages that it produces.
Using <code>pass</code> and <code>gpg</code> requires to overcome a significant learning barrier, and you are required to know and understand
the 'Web of Trust' and all the error messages that come with not having one big enough to encrypt for the desired
recipients.</p>
<p><code>sheesy</code> is built with <em>great user experience</em> as first class requirement, and even though you will always see the underlying
<code>gpg</code> error, it will explain what it means and provide you with hints to solve the issue. When encryption fails, it will
list exactly for which recipient you cannot encrypt, and why.</p>
<p><code>pass</code> even has a <a href="https://git.zx2c4.com/password-store/tree/">few tests</a>, but it's unclear when and where these run. <code>sheesy</code> is developed in a test-driven
fashion, and has user-centric tests that model real-world interaction. This is the reason why those interactions are designed
to be understandable, consistent and easy to remember.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#gopass" id="gopass"><h3>Gopass</h3></a>
<p><a href="https://github.com/justwatchcom/gopass"><code>gopass</code></a> is '<em>the slightly more awesome standard unix password manager for teams</em>' as claimed on the projects
github page. As I have never used it beyond trying it locally, this paragraph might be lacking details. However, a first
impression is worth something, and here we go.</p>
<p>As it is a <code>go</code> program, it comes without any dependencies except for the <code>gpg</code> executable. It calls it directly, and thus
would be vulnerable to changes to the way <code>gpg</code> parses its arguments.</p>
<p>It's feature-ladden and seems overwhelming at first, it is clearly not centered
around user experience. Otherwise the user-journey would be much more streamlined and easier to comprehend. Many advanced
features I certainly don't get to enjoy that way.</p>
<p>Somewhat a sybling of the issue above seems to be that it is hell-bent on being a personal password store.
Thus it will store meta-data in your home directory and really wants a root-store which is placed in your
home by default. So-called 'mounts' are really just a way to let it know about other <code>pass</code> compatible vaults,
and I believe that makes it a buzz-word. Nonetheless, this made it hard for me to get started with it, and I still
feel highly uncomfortable to use it thanks to it opinionatedness.</p>
<p>Last but not least, and an issue that I find makes the case for not using <code>gopass</code> is that it actually
<a href="https://github.com/justwatchcom/gopass/issues/305">abandons the <code>Web of Trust</code></a> in favor of simplicity to the user. Even though I understand
why one would do that, I think the <code>Web of Trust</code> is an awesome idea, with terrible user experience, which
just begs you to make it usable for the masses thanks to better tooling.</p>
<p>Additionally <code>gopass</code> just aims to be a <em>slightly more awesome</em> than <code>pass</code>, which shows as it is basically
pass written in <code>go</code> with more features.</p>
<p>Even though it certainly is better than <code>pass</code>, I wouldn't want to use it in its place because it adds so much
complexity while entirely removing the 'Web of Trust'. The latter seemed to have happened rather sneakily, which
I find problematic.</p>
<p>It should be valued that they <a href="https://github.com/justwatchcom/gopass/search?q=Increase+test+coverage&amp;type=Commits&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93">actively increase test-coverage</a>, but it also means that they don't
do test-driven development, which nourishes my doubt in the quality of the software.</p>

USAGE:
    sy &lt;SUBCOMMAND&gt;

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

SUBCOMMANDS:
    vault          Various commands to store and retrieve secrets and control who has access.
    substitute     Substitutes templates using structured data. The idea is to build a tree of data that is used to
                   substitute in various templates, using multiple inputs and outputs.That way, secrets (like
                   credentials) can be extracted from the vault just once and used wherever needed without them
                   touching disk.Liquid is used as template engine, and it's possible to refer to and inherit from
                   other templates by their file-stem. Read more on their website at
                   https://shopify.github.io/liquid .
    process        Merge JSON or YAML files from standard input from specified files. Multi-document YAML files are
                   supported. Merging a single file is explicitly valid and can be used to check for syntax errors.
    extract        Extract scalar or complex values from any JSON or YAML file. Multi-document YAML files are
                   supported.
    completions    generate completions for supported shell
    help           Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

<p>Even though secrets that are not shared with anyone (but yourself) are great for
security, they are not too useful in many settings.</p>
<p>So we will add our first recipient, <em>Alexis</em>!</p>
<p>As always, <em>Alexis</em> will require an own <em>gpg key</em>, and for the sake of simplicity
we will assume it is already present.</p>
<p>Usually it's also easiest to let new recipients 'knock at the door of the vault',
and leave it to existing recipients of the vault to 'let them in'.</p>
<p>In this analogy, 'knocking the door' is equivalent to placing their key in the vaults
keys directory. 'Letting them in' means re-encrypting all <em>resources</em> for the
current and the new recipients after verifying their key truly belongs to them.</p>
<p>That's quite a lot to digest, so let's start and make small steps.</p>
<p>Let's let <em>Alexis</em> look at the vault:</p>

it wants you to add the fingerprint, which you should also have received by <em>Alexis</em>.
This links the key (identified by its fingerprint) to <em>Alexis</em>.</p>
<p>Let's spell it out:</p>

<p>Let's look at the steps that it performs in details:</p>

<li><em>import</em>
<ul>
<li>it finds <em>Alexis</em> key as identified by the fingerprint in the vaults keys
directory and <em>imports</em> it into the <em>gpg keychain</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>signing</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Alexis</em> key is signed with the one of the prime recipient, which indicates
we verified that it truly belongs to <em>Alexis</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>export</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Alexis</em> key is re-exported as it now also contains said signature. The fact
that the prime recipient believes that the key belongs to <em>Alexis</em> is communicated
to others that way, which helps building the <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x547.html">Web of Trust</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>encrypt</em>

<li>Each <em>resource</em> of the vault is re-encrypted for all recipients. This means
<em>Alexis</em> will be able to get to peek inside.</li>

<p>The <code>vault</code> sub-command is quite a complex one as it implements all interactions with <strong>vaults</strong>.
A <strong>vault</strong> contains shared secrets, and is compatible to the <a href="http://passwordstore.org/">unix password manager</a>.</p>
<p>It provides subcommands for dealing with two kinds of items</p>
<ul>
<li><em>resources</em></li>
<li><em>recipients</em></li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="print.html#about-resources" id="about-resources"><h3>About Resources</h3></a>
<p>Most of the time, when using the <em>vault</em>, you will deal with the <em>resources</em> contained
within. A <em>resource</em> is an encrypted secret so that it is readable and writable by
all <em>recipients</em>.</p>
<p><em>Resources</em> can be <em>add</em>ed, <em>remove</em>d, <em>edit</em>ed, <em>list</em>ed and <em>show</em>n.</p>
<p><strong>As they are used most of the time, they are found directly in the <code>vault</code> sub-command.</strong></p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#about-recipients" id="about-recipients"><h3>About Recipients</h3></a>
<p>Each recipient is identified by their <em>gpg-key</em>, which is tied to their identity.
New recipients can only be added by existing recipients of the vault, which also requires
them to verify that the new key truly belongs to the respective person.</p>
<p>Recipients may indicate trust-relationships between each other, which allows
to encrypt for recipients whose keys have not been explicitly verified.
This is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust">Web of trust</a>, a feature that <code>sheesy</code> makes easier to use.</p>
<p><strong>As they are used less often, they are tucked away in the <code>recipients</code> sub-command.</strong></p>

Various commands to store and retrieve secrets and control who has access.

USAGE:
    sy vault [OPTIONS] --config-file &lt;path&gt; [SUBCOMMAND]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help    Prints help information

OPTIONS:
    -s, --select &lt;selector&gt;     Specify the vault which should be the leader.This is particularly relevant for
                                operations with partitions.It has no effect during 'vault init'.A vault can be selected
                                by the directory used to stored its resources, by its name (which may be ambiguous), or
                                by the index in the vault description file. [default: 0]
    -c, --config-file &lt;path&gt;    Path to the vault configuration YAML file. [default: ./sy-vault.yml]

SUBCOMMANDS:
    init          Initialize the vault in the current directory. If --gpg-key-id is unset, we will use the only key
                  that you have a secret key for, assuming it is yours.If you have multiple keys, the --gpg-key-id
                  must be specified to make the input unambiguous.
    add           Add a new resource to the vault.
    edit          Edit a resource. This will decrypt the resource to a temporary file, open up the $EDITOR you have
                  specified, and re-encrypt the changed content before deleting it on disk.
    show          Decrypt a resource
    list          List the vault's content.
    remove        Delete a resource from the vault.
    recipients    Interact with recipients of a vault. They can encrypt and decrypt its contents.
    partitions    A partition is essentially another vault, as such it has its own recipients list, name, keys
                  directory place to store resources.Its major promise is that it is non-overlapping with any other
                  partition.Its main benefit is that it allows one recipients list per resource directory,
                  effectively emulating simple access control lists.
    help          Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-bash use=sy-in-path exec">sy vault init --help
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-output">sy-vault-init 
Initialize the vault in the current directory. If --gpg-key-id is unset, we will use the only key that you have a secret
key for, assuming it is yours.If you have multiple keys, the --gpg-key-id must be specified to make the input
unambiguous.

USAGE:
    sy vault --config-file &lt;path&gt; init [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
    -p, --first-partition    Setting this flag indicates that you want to add partitions later.It enforces a
                             configuration which makes your vault suitable, namely it assures that you set an explicit
                             secrets directory.
    -h, --help               Prints help information
        --no-auto-import     If set, missing keys will not automatically be imported to your keychain. This may make
                             attempts to encrypt resources fail.

OPTIONS:
    -i, --gpg-key-id &lt;userid&gt;...      The key-id of the public key identifying a recipient in your gpg keychain.
    -k, --gpg-keys-dir &lt;directory&gt;    The directory to hold the public keys of all recipients.Please note that these
                                      keys are exported with signatures. [default: .gpg-keys]
    -n, --name &lt;name&gt;                 The name of the vault. It can be used to identify the vault more easily, and its
                                      primary purpose is convenience.
    -r, --recipients-file &lt;path&gt;      The path to the file to hold the fingerprints of all recipients. If set to just
                                      the file name, like 'recipients', it will be interpreted as relative to the
                                      --secrets-dir. If a path is given, like './recipients', it is used as is.
                                      [default: .gpg-id]
    -s, --secrets-dir &lt;path&gt;          The directory which stores the vaults secrets. [default: .]
        --trust-model &lt;model&gt;         The model by which keys to encrypt for are verified to truly belong to the person.
                                      If unset, it defaults to 'always'.'always': whenever a key has been added to the
                                      vault, it is trusted without your intervention. 'web-of-trust': the standard GPG
                                      web of trust with default rules. In the most simple case, you will need to sign a
                                      key prior to be able to encrypt for it. [default: always]  [possible values: web-
                                      of-trust, always]

<p>Tools are everything not directly related to managing secrets, and help to use them
while avoiding them to touch disk.</p>
<p>This can be achieved by putting the following capabilities together:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Context Creation</strong>
<ul>
<li>A context is just a bunch of properties in a structure.</li>
<li>Used to instantiate and customize templates.</li>
<li>Parts of it may be secret.</li>
<li>It can live in multiple places, such as files and in-memory as it is produced
in real-time by programs. The latter can be 'sheesy' decrypting a file on the fly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Template Substitution</strong>
<ul>
<li>Using a templating engine and a set of templates, the data can be placed in
any kind of file to be consumed by other tools.</li>
<li>It's also useful to maintain a library of templates which are controlled by
contexts, which change depending on the one use-case.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<pre><code class="language-output">sy-substitute 
Substitutes templates using structured data. The idea is to build a tree of data that is used to substitute in various
templates, using multiple inputs and outputs.That way, secrets (like credentials) can be extracted from the vault just
once and used wherever needed without them touching disk.Liquid is used as template engine, and it's possible to refer
to and inherit from other templates by their file-stem. Read more on their website at https://shopify.github.io/liquid .

            Prints help information

        --no-stdin    
            If set, we will not try to read structured data from standard input. This may be required in some situations
            where we are blockingly reading from a standard input which is attached to a pseudo-terminal.
    -v, --validate    
            If set, the instantiated template will be parsed as YAML or JSON. If both of them are invalid, the command
            will fail.

OPTIONS:
    -d, --data=&lt;data&gt;
            Structured data in YAML or JSON format to use when instantiating/substituting the template. If set,
            everything from standard input is interpreted as template.
    -e, --engine=&lt;name&gt;
            The choice of engine used for the substitution. Valid values are 'handlebars' and 'liquid'. 'liquid', the
            default, is coming with batteries included and very good at handling
                                   one template at a time.
                                   'handlebars' supports referencing other templates using partials, which is useful for
            sharing of common functionality. [default: liquid]  [possible values: handlebars, liquid]
        --partial=&lt;template&gt;...
            A file to be read as partial template, whose name will be the its file stem. It can then be included from
            another template, and thus act as a function call.
        --replace=&lt;find-this:replace-with-that&gt;...
            A simple find &amp; replace for values for the string data to be placed into the template. The word to find is
            the first specified argument, the second one is the word to replace it with, e.g. -r=foo:bar.
    -s, --separator=&lt;separator&gt;
            The string to use to separate multiple documents that are written to the same stream. This can be useful to
            output a multi-document YAML file from multiple input templates to stdout if the separator is '---'. The
            separator is also used when writing multiple templates into the same file, like in 'a:out b:out'. [default: 
            ]

ARGS:
    &lt;template-spec&gt;...    
            Identifies the how to map template files to output. The syntax is '&lt;src&gt;:&lt;dst&gt;'. &lt;src&gt; and &lt;dst&gt; are a
            relative or absolute paths to the source templates or destination files respectively. If &lt;src&gt; is
            unspecified, the template will be read from stdin, e.g. ':output'. Only one spec can read from stdin. If
            &lt;dst&gt; is unspecified, the substituted template will be output to stdout, e.g 'input.hbs:' or 'input.hbs'.
            Multiple templates are separated by the '--separator' accordingly. This is particularly useful for YAML
            files,where the separator should be `$'---\n'`

<p>By default, this is standard ouptut, but can easily be <code>some-file.yml</code>, as in <code>./some-file.tpl:out/some-file.yml</code>.</p>

<p>At first sight, it might not be so useful to output multiple templates to standard output.
Some formats are built just for that usecase, provided you separate the documents correctly.</p>
<p>If there are multiple YAML files for instance, you can separate them like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash use=in-fixtures use=sy-in-path exec=0">echo 'value: 42' \

<p>When generating structured data files, like YAML or JSON, even with a valid template you
are very vulnerable to the values contained in the data-model. Some passwords for instance
may contain characters which break your output. Even though <code>--validate</code> can tell you right away,

<p>The substitution can be performed by various engines, each with their distinct advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>This section sums up their highlights.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#liquid-default" id="liquid-default"><h4>Liquid (default)</h4></a>
<p>The <a href="http://shopify.github.io/liquid/"><code>Liquid</code> template engine</a> was originally created for web-shops and is both easy to use as well as fully-featured.</p>
<p>It’s main benefit is its various filters, which can be used to put something into uppercase (<code>{{ “something” | uppercase }}</code>), or to encode text into base64 (<code>{{ “text” | base64 }}</code>).</p>
<p>There are a few filters which have been added for convenience:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>base64</strong>
<ul>
<li>Converts anything into its base64 representation.</li>
<li>No arguments are supported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="print.html#handlebars" id="handlebars"><h4>Handlebars</h4></a>
<p>The first optional template engine is <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com"><code>handlebars</code></a>. Compared to <code>Liquid</code>, it’s rather bare-bone and does not support any filters. The filtering syntax also makes chained filters more cumbersome.</p>
<p>However, it allows you to use <em>partials</em>, which are good to model something like multiple sites, which share a header and a footer. The shared portions are filled with data that contextually originates in the page that uses them.</p>
<p>For example, in an invocation like this you can declare headers and footers without rendering them, and then output multiple pages that use it.</p>
<p><em>Here is the content of the files used</em>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash use=in-fixtures exec">cat data.json
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-output">{
  &quot;title&quot; : &quot;Main Heading&quot;,
  &quot;parent&quot; : &quot;base0&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-bash use=in-fixtures exec">cat base0.hbs
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-output">&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;{{title}}&lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Derived from base0.hbs&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    {{~&gt; page}}
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-bash use=in-fixtures exec">cat template.hbs

<pre><code class="language-output">{{#*inline &quot;page&quot;}}
  &lt;p&gt;Rendered in partial, parent is {{parent}}&lt;/p&gt;
{{/inline}}
{{~&gt; (parent)~}}
</code></pre>
<p>When using these in substitution, this is the output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash use=in-fixtures use=sy-in-path exec">sy substitute --engine=handlebars -d data.json base0.hbs:/dev/null template.hbs
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-output">&lt;html&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Derived from base0.hbs&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Rendered in partial, parent is base0&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The perceived disadvantage of having close to zero available filters would have to be compensated using a processing program which takes the data, and adds all the variations that you would need in your templates:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash use=in-fixtures use=sy-in-path exec">./data-processor &lt; data.json | sy substitute template.tpl

<pre><code class="language-output">The normal title: Main Heading

                          assignment like 'a=42' or a.b.c=value.

<p>You can also use these aliases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>merge</strong></li>
<li><strong>show</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It helps to use this powerful command by understanding its mindset a little.</p>
<ul>
<li>it wants to produce a single document <em>(JSON or YAML)</em> from multiple input documents <em>(JSON or YAML)</em></li>
<li>by default, it will <em>refuse to overwrite</em> existing values</li>
<li>multi-document YAML files are fully supported</li>
<li>standard input is a valid source for documents</li>
<li>the order of arguments matter, as this program is implemented as <em>state-machine</em></li>
<li>by default it produces <em>JSON</em> output</li>
</ul>
<p>This program helps to quickly manipulate various inputs and produce a new output, which can then
more easily be used in programs like <code>sy substitute</code>, or to generate configuration files.</p>
<p>Now let's look typical use-cases.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#merge-multiple-documents-into-one" id="merge-multiple-documents-into-one"><h3>Merge multiple documents into one</h3></a>
<p>This case often arises by the mere necessity of keeping things separate. Even though
keeping all data in a single structured data file would work just fine, in practice
not all information is under your direct control and thus pulled in separately from
other locations.</p>
<p>For substitution, multiple files are not viable, which is why a single file should be produced
instead:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash use=in-fixtures exec">sy merge --at=project project.yml --at=team team.yml
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-output">{
  &quot;project&quot;: {
    &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;ios-game&quot;,
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;super-punch&quot;
  },
  &quot;team&quot;: {
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;dept. nine&quot;,
    &quot;product-owner&quot;: &quot;Max Owner&quot;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, we use the <code>--at</code> flag to put the contents of both files into their
own namespaces. Without that, we would have a clashing <code>name</code> field which makes the
program fail.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash use=in-fixtures exec=1">sy merge project.yml team.yml
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-output">error: The merge failed due to conflicts
Caused by: 
 1: Refusing to merge due to the following clashing keys:
name


</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#overwriting-individual-values-or-creating-new-ones" id="overwriting-individual-values-or-creating-new-ones"><h3>Overwriting individual values (or creating new ones)</h3></a>
<p>Sometimes during testing, it's useful to change a single value, in the configuration
for instance. You can easily do this using the <code>key=value</code> specification.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash use=in-fixtures exec=1">sy merge game-config.yml player.lives=99
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-output">error: The merge failed due to conflicts
Caused by: 
 1: Refusing to merge due to the following clashing keys:
player.lives


</code></pre>
<p>However, the above fails as we won't ever overwrite existing values. Let's try to
argue with the program to make it work nonetheless:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash use=in-fixtures exec=1">sy merge game-config.yml player.lives=99 --overwrite
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-output">error: The merge failed due to conflicts
Caused by: 
 1: Refusing to merge due to the following clashing keys:
player.lives


</code></pre>
<p>This might appear unexpected, even though it is not when you have understood that the order
matters. In the example above, <code>--overwrite</code> simply applies too late for overwriting the
value. If we swap their positions, it will work.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash use=in-fixtures exec">sy merge game-config.yml  --overwrite player.lives=99 player.invincible=true
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-output">{
  &quot;enemies&quot;: {
    &quot;cheat&quot;: true,
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;aliens&quot;
  },
  &quot;player&quot;: {
    &quot;invincible&quot;: true,
    &quot;lives&quot;: 99
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Please note that <code>--overwrite</code> acts as a toggle and affects all following arguments. You can
toggle it back off with the <code>--no-overwrite</code> flag</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash use=in-fixtures exec">sy merge game-config.yml  --overwrite player.lives=99 \
        --no-overwrite --at=project project.yml --at=team team.yml \

<p>It's most common to have different sets of configuration for different environments. For example, most
deploy to at least two stages: <em>pre-production</em> and <em>production</em>.</p>
<p>When using <code>sy process</code> for generating configuration to be used by tooling, it's not practical to force
the tooling to know the stage.</p>
<p>Imagine the following configuration file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash use=in-fixtures exec">cat multi-stage-config.yml
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-output">pre-production:
  replicas: 1
  max-cpu: 200mi

production:
  replicas: 3
  max-cpu: 2000mi
  max-memory: 1024M
</code></pre>
<p>Tools either get to know which stage configuration to use, or you 'pull it up' for them:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash use=in-fixtures exec">sy process --select=production multi-stage-config.yml -o yaml

<a class="header" href="print.html#controlling-standard-input" id="controlling-standard-input"><h3>Controlling standard input</h3></a>
<p>We will read JSON or YAML from standard input if possible. To make it more flexible,
any <em>non-path</em> flags are applied to standard input. This may lead to unexpected output
if more than one document source is specified.</p>
<p>Let's start with a simple case:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash use=in-fixtures exec">cat team.yml | sy process --at=team-from-stdin
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-output">{
  &quot;team-from-stdin&quot;: {
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;dept. nine&quot;,
    &quot;product-owner&quot;: &quot;Max Owner&quot;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the moment another file is added for processing, it's a bit more difficult to
control which argument applies where:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash use=in-fixtures exec">cat team.yml | sy process --at=team-from-stdin --at=project project.yml
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-output">{
  &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;ios-game&quot;,
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;super-punch&quot;,
  &quot;project&quot;: {
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;dept. nine&quot;,
    &quot;product-owner&quot;: &quot;Max Owner&quot;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the <code>project</code> key is used for standard input, and the <code>team-from-stdin</code>
is seemingly ignored.</p>
<p>To fix this, be explicit to make obvious what you expect:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash use=in-fixtures exec">cat team.yml | sy process --at=team-from-stdin - --at=project project.yml
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-output">{
  &quot;project&quot;: {
    &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;ios-game&quot;,
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;super-punch&quot;
  },
  &quot;team-from-stdin&quot;: {
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;dept. nine&quot;,
    &quot;product-owner&quot;: &quot;Max Owner&quot;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note the single <code>dash (-)</code>, which indicates when to read from standard input. As
standard input is always consumed entirely, it can only be specified <em>once</em>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash use=sy-in-path exec">sy extract --help
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-output">sy-extract 
Extract scalar or complex values from any JSON or YAML file. Multi-document YAML files are supported.

USAGE:
    sy extract [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] &lt;pointer&gt;...

FLAGS:
    -h, --help        Prints help information
        --no-stdin    If set, we will not try to read structured data from standard input. This may be required in some
                      situations where we are blockingly reading from a standard input which is attached to a pseudo-
                      terminal.

OPTIONS:
    -f, --file=&lt;file&gt;...    The path to the file to include, or '-' to read from standard input. It must be in a format
                            that can be output using the --output flag.
    -o, --output=&lt;mode&gt;     Specifies how the extracted result should be serialized. If the output format is not
                            explicitly set, the output will be a single scalar value per line. If the output contains a
                            complex value, the default serialization format will be used. [possible values: json, yaml]

ARGS:
    &lt;pointer&gt;...    Use a JSON pointer to specify which value to extract. Valid specifications are for example
                    '0/a/b/4' or 'a.b.0', and they must point to a valid value.
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use this alias: <strong>fetch</strong>.</p>
<p>The <code>extract</code> sub-command is meant for those cases when you need individual values from
a file with structured data, for example when consuming credentials in scripts.</p>
<p>When extracting scalar values, those will be output <em>one per line</em>. If an extracted value
<em>is not scalar</em>, e.g. an object or array, the output mode of all extracted values will change
to JSON (default) or YAML with <code>--output</code>.</p>
<p>All values are specified using <a href="http://rapidjson.org/md_doc_pointer.html">JSON-pointer notation</a>, with the added convenience
that slashes <em>(-)</em> can be exchanged with dots <em>(.)</em> .</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#extracting-username-and-password" id="extracting-username-and-password"><h3>Extracting username and password</h3></a>
<p>Given an input file like this, here is how you can extract <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> for usage
in scripts:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash use=in-fixtures exec">cat credentials.yml
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-output">user:
  name: Hans
  password: geheim
</code></pre>
<p>Extract using the JSON pointer syntax is quite straightforward, and rather forgiving:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash use=in-fixtures exec">sy extract -f=credentials.yml user.name /user/password
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-output">Hans
geheim
</code></pre>
<p>From here it should be easy to assign individual values to variables for use in scripts</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash use=in-fixtures exec">password=&quot;$(sy extract user.password &lt; credentials.yml)&quot;
username=&quot;$(sy extract user.name &lt; credentials.yml)&quot;
echo Authorization: Basic $(echo $username:$password | base64)

</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#collecting-individual-values-into-a-structured-format" id="collecting-individual-values-into-a-structured-format"><h3>Collecting individual values into a structured format</h3></a>

a single line per value.
Otherwise, you will either get a list of JSON or YAML values.</p>
